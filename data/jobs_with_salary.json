What do I mean by \u00e2\u0080\u009csmall\u00e2\u0080\u009d?

The more we develop the platform (and the ability to self-serve in the marketplace), the more efficient the whole process becomes, which means more money going back to educators and into classrooms (over \u00c2\u00a330 million since 2017).&nbsp;<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>We are well established in the UK and growing at a phenomenal rate in the US \u00f0\u009f\u009a\u0080<\/p><p><br><\/p><p>What we need now is to reach the next level in how we build our platform to support this growth.

Our Product Managers and Designers are partners you pull on for leverage rather than task givers who hide the users away.<\/p><p>\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 <b>Daily shipping culture<\/b>. We ship regularly and want to get even better at it.

You won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t see titles like Associate, Senior, or Staff here. Instead, you can grow continuously by getting better at your current role - e.g. working faster, safer, and more independently. Changing roles is possible too, but depends on business needs, since different roles aim for different business outcomes and typically use different skills.<\/p><p>\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 <b>Investment over reward as a mindset.<\/b> Level changes are tightly coupled to compensation changes. Confidence in a Level change is based on sustainably doing great work at <i>your current level.<\/i> We think it is fairer to invest in what you do next, rather than reward you doing the next Level first for free!<\/p><p><br><\/p><p><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\">\u00f0\u009f\u0092\u00b8 <\/span><b style=\"font-size: 18px;\">Compensation<\/b><\/p><p>\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 <b>Market reality.<\/b> Compensation is based on your competitiveness in your local hiring market (note that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just where you live).
